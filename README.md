# 🎨 Studio Color

**Studio Color** is a modern, color-focused mobile application built with **Flutter** that helps designers, developers, and creatives discover, extract, analyze, and work with colors and color palettes.

The application provides a collection of practical color tools, including palette generation, image color extraction, color analysis, accessibility checking, and color-blindness simulation.

---

## 📱 Project Overview

Studio Color was designed to provide an all-in-one workspace for working with colors without relying on multiple separate tools.

Users can explore different color palettes, extract dominant colors from images, analyze individual colors, check accessibility and contrast ratios, and simulate how colors may appear to people with different types of color vision deficiency.

The project focuses on combining **modern UI/UX**, **color theory**, **accessibility**, and **practical developer tools** into a single mobile experience.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎨 Color Palette Generation

Generate and explore color palettes based on different color relationships and combinations.

Users can:

* Discover new color combinations.
* Explore multiple palette variations.
* View colors with their corresponding values.
* Save favorite palettes.
* Copy color values for use in other projects.

---

### 🖼️ Image Color Extraction

Studio Color allows users to select an image and extract its dominant colors.

The extraction process identifies important colors from the selected image and presents them as a usable color palette.

**Use cases:**

* Extracting brand colors from an image.
* Finding colors from photography.
* Creating UI palettes from visual references.
* Getting inspiration from existing designs.

---

### 🔬 Color Analysis

Users can analyze individual colors and inspect their different color representations.

The application provides useful color information such as:

* HEX
* RGB
* HSL
* Color values and properties
* Visual color preview

This makes it easier for designers and developers to work with colors across different design and development environments.

---

### ♿ Accessibility & WCAG

One of the main goals of Studio Color is helping developers and designers create more accessible interfaces.

The application can analyze color combinations and provide accessibility information based on **WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)** principles.

Users can check:

* Foreground and background colors.
* Contrast ratio.
* Accessibility level.
* Whether a combination passes common WCAG requirements.

This helps identify color combinations that may be difficult for users to read.

---

### 👁️ Color Blindness Simulation

Studio Color includes color-blindness simulation tools that demonstrate how colors and images may appear under different types of color vision deficiency.

This feature can help designers understand how their color choices may affect users with different visual perception conditions.

The application provides simulations for common color vision deficiencies, allowing users to compare the original colors with simulated results.

---

### ⭐ Favorites

Users can save useful colors and palettes for later access.

The favorites system allows users to:

* Save palettes.
* Save important colors.
* Remove saved items.
* Access saved content quickly.

Favorite data is persisted locally so it can remain available between application sessions.

---

### 🔎 Search

Studio Color provides search functionality to make finding colors and palettes easier.

Users can search through available color-related content instead of manually browsing through the entire collection.

---

### 📋 Copy Color Values

Users can quickly copy color values such as HEX codes to the clipboard.

This makes it convenient to transfer colors from Studio Color directly into:

* Flutter projects
* Web projects
* Design tools
* UI/UX workflows
* Graphic design software

                       ▼
                       UI
```

This separation makes the application easier to test, maintain, and extend.

---

## 🌐 Custom Color Processing API

Studio Color uses a custom API for some of its image and color-processing functionality.

The backend handles operations such as:

* Image processing.
* Dominant color extraction.
* Color clustering.
* Palette generation.
* Color analysis.

The API can process an uploaded image and return structured color information that the Flutter application can display.

---

## 🧠 Color Extraction Technology

The image-processing system can use techniques such as:

* **PIL (Python Imaging Library)** for image processing.
* **K-Means Clustering** for grouping similar colors.
* **ColorThief** for extracting dominant colors.

A simplified processing flow:

```text

Image Processing
  │
  ▼
Resize / Normalize
  │
  ▼
Extract Pixel Colors
  │
  ▼
K-Means Clustering
  │
  ▼
Identify Dominant Colors
  │
  ▼
Generate Palette
  │
  ▼
Return Color Data
```

---

## 🔥 Firebase Integration

Firebase is used to provide cloud-based functionality.

Depending on the enabled application features, Firebase can handle:

### Authentication

User authentication and account management.

### Cloud Firestore

Stores application/user-related data such as:

* User information
* Favorite palettes
* Saved colors
* Application data

### Firebase Storage

Used for storing files and images when required by the application.

---

## 💾 Local Data Persistence

Studio Color uses local storage to improve the user experience and preserve important user data.

For example:

```text
User Action
    │
    ▼
Save Favorite
    │
    ▼
SharedPreferences
    │
    ▼
Persist Data Locally
    │
    ▼
Load Data on App Start
```

This allows selected data to remain available after closing and reopening the application.

---

## 🎯 Design Goals

Studio Color was built around several key principles:

### Simplicity

Color tools should be easy to understand and use without unnecessary complexity.

### Accessibility

Color selection should consider users with different visual abilities.

### Productivity

Common color-related tasks should be available in one application.

### Modern UI

The interface uses a clean, modern visual language with strong emphasis on color.

### Developer Friendly

Color values should be easy to inspect, copy, and reuse in development projects.

---

## 🎨 UI/UX

The UI was designed around the concept of color itself.

Key design considerations include:

* Minimal interface.
* Clear visual hierarchy.
* Color-focused components.
* Easy navigation.
* Responsive layouts.
* Clear interaction states.
* Consistent spacing and typography.
* Accessible contrast where appropriate.

The application avoids unnecessary visual elements so the colors remain the main focus of the interface.
